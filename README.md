Hi! This is Luther Williamson's submission to The Developer Academy's tech test, "Visible Points".

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the 3 pieces of information in the example:
 - Point number
 - Angle to look either side of given direction
 - Distance to look

All visible points will be printed to the console, rinse and repeat.

I decided to interpret the angle as it would appear on an XY-plane where the axes are the same scale, unlike the example given in the question where the 45 degree angle is drawn by going 2 up for every 1 across.

If you have any questions please contact me:

Thanks!
